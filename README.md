# Exploratory-Data-Analysis---Mini-Project-1

In the following analysis, we are going to answer a specific research question posed to us - Can the increase
in life expectancy since World War 2 be largely explained by increases in GDP per capita?
To answer the above question, the gapminder dataset is used as it contains the required information from
the year 1952 to the year 2007. This EDA will thus give an overview on how the relationship has changed
between the life expectancy and GDP per capita over the years.
